# Advocate Search Project

## TODO:

### 1. Separate Search and Grid Components:

Objective: Break the current AdvocateGrid component into smaller, more manageable components, specifically separating the search functionality and grid rendering into different components. This will improve readability and maintainability.

### 2. Add Branding and Colors per Solace Color Palette:

Objective: Implement the branding guidelines and color palette of Solace into the UI. This includes adjusting colors, fonts, and possibly adding a logo or other branding elements for consistency with the brandâ€™s identity.

### 3. Enhance Design Aesthetics:

Objective: Improve the overall design of the application by refining the layout, spacing, fonts, and UI elements to make the interface visually appealing, user-friendly, and consistent.

### 4. Further Analyze and Tweak Frontend Performance:

Objective: Analyze the current performance of the frontend, especially for large datasets and optimize rendering performance. Consider strategies like lazy loading, reducing unnecessary renders, and improving the responsiveness of interactions.

### 5. Protect Against Bad Strings or Too Long Inputs:

Objective: Implement validation or sanitization mechanisms to ensure that user inputs (such as the search term) are properly validated and sanitized before sending to the API. Handle edge cases such as overly long strings or special characters that could break the app or database queries.

### 6. Authorization Handling of API:

Objective: Implement proper authorization handling for the API routes. Ensure that only authorized users can access certain data or perform certain actions, potentially using tokens or sessions for secure access.

### 7. Add Unit or E2E Testing:

Objective: Implement unit or end-to-end (E2E) tests for critical components of the app, ensuring that functionalities work as expected and bugs are identified early in the development process. This can include tests for search functionality, rendering of the advocate grid, and API responses.
